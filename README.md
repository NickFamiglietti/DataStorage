## Potential Modifications
This assignment could be modified in order to become an official assignment in the future by asking students to submit documentation. By asking students to implement 
documentation this will allow for proper comments and code documentation which would improve overall readiability. Another possible enhancement is establishing a channel 
where students can present their approaches and discuss decsions they made to make their assignment a success. Lastly, develop a CLI to potentially interact with the database 
to enhance a user experience which goes along with a topic we have already discussed this semester. Overall, I thought this was a quality assignment that enhanced my 
knowledge and by adding these suggestions I have mentioned, it could be turned into an "official" assignment in the future.
